---

## A game with Rock, Paper, Scissors

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player.
* You can find the "official" rules of the game on the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.

## New stuffs

* Add validation for use input with exception handing for 0, 1, 2 
* Not yet adding exception handing for Yes/No continuing game
