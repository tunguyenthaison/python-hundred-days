# The Higher-Lower game
## The easy way
- Use data provided from the course, as a list
- Function to randomly selected an entry, return data in 'name', 'follower_count', 'description' and 'country'
- Logic of the game, as a function
- A counter to count #(lives), a counter to record score
- A temp variable to hold the current data
- while loop while (#lives > 0)
- show game data and ask for input
- record input, update lives and scores

## Todos
